# ZARBTC

Collection of scripts for janky round trip trading of BTC, USD, ZAR. 

I take no responsibility for the quality of the code in this repo whatsoever; you should assume it is broken, possibly malicious, and that, if you actually get it to work, that the math is actually wrong.

## Usage

The primary current purpose of this codebase is to monitor the after-cost BTC premium in South Africa relative to the prevailing international spot price. 

The results of the computation ar in the html file in the `docs` directory. This html file is hosted at https://riazarbi.github.io/zarbtc. 

My old trading scripts are in `scratch`. They may be resurrected at some point.

## Help
